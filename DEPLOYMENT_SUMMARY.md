# Local Development Setup Complete

## What's Been Configured

✅ **Environment Variables Setup**
- Added dotenv, dotenv-cli, and nanoid packages
- Created comprehensive `.env` template with all required variables
- Updated server to automatically load environment configuration
- Configured email service to use environment settings

✅ **Path Resolution Fixed**
- Fixed production build path issues for static file serving
- Added proper path resolution for upload directories
- Ensured compatibility with both development and production environments

✅ **Local Development Tools**
- `run-local.js` - Enhanced Node.js runner with validation
- `start-local.sh` - Bash script for Unix systems  
- `LOCAL_SETUP.md` - Comprehensive setup documentation
- `README.md` - Updated with quick start guide

## Required Configuration

Before running locally, edit your `.env` file:

```env
# Required
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/database
SESSION_SECRET=your-secure-random-string

# Optional (for email features)
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-app-password
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@yourdomain.com
```

## Running Locally

Choose one of these methods:

1. **Enhanced runner** (recommended): `node run-local.js`
2. **Bash script**: `./start-local.sh` 
3. **Direct**: `npm run dev`

All methods include environment validation and helpful error messages.

## Production Build Notes

The production build process requires:
- Frontend compilation (can take 3-5 minutes due to dependencies)
- Backend bundling with proper path resolution
- Static file directory structure

For local development, using `npm run dev` is recommended over production builds.

## Key Improvements

- Environment-based configuration instead of hardcoded values
- Proper path resolution for different deployment scenarios
- Comprehensive error handling and validation
- Clear documentation for setup and troubleshooting
- Multiple startup options for different environments

The application is now fully configured for local development with proper environment variable management and comprehensive documentation.
